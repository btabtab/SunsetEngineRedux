    This file will be responsible for containing
    the mythical "Thread Wizard" who will control
    and manage the different threads the engine
    allowing for faster physics handling and
    processing so that applications can do
    MORE in LESS time.

    This will be worked on seperate to the main
    engine and will probably merge at a MUCH
    later date.
